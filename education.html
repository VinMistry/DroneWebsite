                    <h3> Building Drones</h3>
                    <p>
                         <strong>Robotics: </strong>One of the most obvious and direct areas that drones can teach students about is robotics. This in itself is useful not just in learning principles of say, mechanical actuators or electrical systems, but in honing the analytical thinking skills needed to understand how many different disciplines function together to make a single system work – and then, to make multiple systems work together. In many ways, this is the basis for thinking about programming and bigger logic problems, as it requires “If, then” kind of thinking, i.e. “If I do this, this event happens.” For students who may eventually want to become engineers, this kind of mental play is exactly what’s needed – all the more so as engineers are increasingly required to become Jacks of all Trades with certain specialty areas, rather than technical experts in a limited field.
                          </p>
                    <p>

                        <strong>Math: </strong>A basic knowledge of trigonometry can be essential in learning how to design and operate drones. At an even higher level, STEM educator, Matthew Schroyer suggests, drones can be used to teach concepts like Bernoulli’s principle as students learn how to predict things such as stall speed. 
 </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Electronics: </strong>As students wire up their microcontroller, they’ll also be learning basic principles of electronics, which they will be able to use widely as they tinker and Make. Students will also learn about electricity as they come to understand the way electric motors operate.
 </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Chemistry:</strong> Students must learn about battery chemistry and capacity in order to truly understand drone design and function.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Programming:</strong> Drones are controlled via a microcontroller that must be programmed. As such, building drones can be a great opportunity to learn programming skills. What’s more, because the microcontroller uses open-source hardware and software, students can experiment with hacking the microcontroller to do, well, whatever they can dream up. We’ve covered one such idea in our piece about creative ways to use iPads, in which we suggested turning tablets into drone remote controls.
                         </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Perseverance and Hands-On Experience </strong>: In talking with an aeronautical engineer for this article, he emphasized that everything in engineering is an approximation of the real world. That means that it’s not uncommon for a theoretical plan to fail when it’s fully realized, whether that be in the form of a drone that crashes or a bridge that collapses. Failure like this, especially when it comes to hands-on learning experiences, teaches character and perseverance. Because failure is inevitable at some point, it becomes a real point of learning and inquisitive investigation as the students asks, “Why did my fool proof plan not work?” It takes bravery for the student to move forward and to continually put him or herself out there with an open mind. And it just so happens that this is the very attitude that makes great learners far beyond the drone tinkering station.

                   <h3> Monitor Natural Disasters</h3>
                    <p>
                        
When natural disasters strike, it is often difficult or even impossible to get eyes on the ground. Drones unlike land vehicles won’t be bothered by broken up roads or hard to reach terrain, and are easier to maneuver, more versatile, and far less expensive than traditional aircraft.

What does this mean for the classroom? If you’re a student in Greenon High School in Dayton, Ohio, it means you can participate in natural disaster exercises, surveying a computer-simulated natural disaster and proposing evacuation routes. Students begin by modeling their own school before moving into more worldly simulations, which gives the exercise both relevance and global importance.
</p>
<h3> Shoot Video for a School Project </h3>
<p>
Drones are being used just about everywhere in Hollywood these days to capture everything from explosions to chase scenes to those wide, breathtaking landscapes. Why not have students do the same for a video project? They could use drones to shoot video reenactment of a famous historical battle. You could even take a video-enabled drone along for an outdoor field trip to capture every moment from up above.
</p>
<h3> Lead a Treasure Hunt </h3>
<p>
Treasure hunts can be a fun and effective learning tool, whether you’re having students track T-rex footprints during your dinosaur unit, or you’re keeping them on the lookout for important landmarks on your big city field trip. Adding a drone into the mix will give students an extra set of eyes and will layer in even more fun.

                    </p>
                   
                        <h3>Navigate a Drone Obstacle Course  </h3>
                         <p>
For students who have fallen in love with their drones and are considering becoming drone pilots as a career, a drone obstacle course is a great way to learn the finer aspect of flying. Make it a competition by adding in tasks for the drones to do along the way, and see who gets to the end first.
  </p>
<h3>Make Art </h3>
 <p>
Drones are versatile because you can attach so many different kinds of objects and tools to them. This includes paintbrushes and paint. Lay a sheet out on the grass, attach paintbrushes, have students lower their drones into paint buckets, and then hover, splash, and air drop paint the whole afternoon through. If you like the results, you could also paint a mural this way, either on a school wall or on the pavement.
  </p>

<h3> Learn About Our Environment in Real Time </h3>
 <p>
Drones are already being used by environmental scientists to measure air quality and test for pollutants. This means drones are a great learning tool for bringing atmospheric science to life. Attach your measuring tools, fly that drone up into the clouds, and see what you can find.
  </p>

<h3> Debate the Ethics </h3>
 <p>
As we noted in the beginning, drones don’t come without controversy. Rather than skirting this reality, embrace it full-on for a formal debate unit. You could have students debate directly over drones themselves, pondering questions about what their role in our future society should be. Or you could broaden the debate to technology in general, prompting students to consider carefully the many good and bad uses of technology, and our responsibility to use it wisely.
  </p>

<h3>Brainstorm Alternative Uses</h3>
 <p>

Brainstorming the many ways one object or technology can be used is a classic test of creativity. As you can see from this list, the possibilities for putting drones to practical use are limited only by the human imagination (and if you’re futurist Thomas Frey, not even by that). As such, drones can be used to powerful effect to nudge students into the kind of creative and innovative thinking they’re going to need in the rapidly changing workplace of today. Such an exercise will also be a needed break within an increasingly assessment-obsessed classroom.
